(Light-mode) not dark mode

Don’t worry too much about these aesthetic considerations below. Generally, I’m just using a white background /dark blue text. 

Background Ribbons: near-black ink with a subtle top-to-bottom gradient (not pure black).


Panels: slightly lighter ink (so sections separate cleanly).


Accents (use sparingly)
Primary accent: teal/green for “safe/approved/on”.


Secondary accent: cool blue for links, citations, and “Trust Model”.


Neutral highlight: soft white/gray for borders and dividers.


Warning: muted amber only for “out-of-scope” or “Exam locked” states.


Rule: accents should appear like signals, not paint.
3) Typography
Headlines: Inter / IBM Plex Sans / Source Sans, weight 650–750.


Body: same family, 16–18px, generous line height (1.6+).


Micro-labels: monospace for system status tags:


COURSE-BOUNDED: ON


CITATION REQUIRED


RETENTION: 0 DAYS


Avoid playful typefaces or overly geometric sci-fi fonts.
4) Layout & spacing
Wide, breathable margins. Plenty of “legal-document calm”.


Grid: 12-col desktop, 4-col mobile.


Sections: consistent rhythm:


Small section label


H2 title


1–2 sentence intro


Cards or steps


Keep the hero clean and scannable. No wall-of-text up top.


5) Components (signature look)
A) Badge pills
Rounded, low-contrast, thin border.


Slight blur/glass effect.


Example styling: dark pill, subtle border, teal dot for emphasis.


B) Cards
Soft radius (16–24px).


Border: 1px faint white.


Background: translucent panel, minimal shadow.


On hover: border brightens slightly, card lifts 2px max.


C) “Trust tags”
 Small rectangular tags (not pills) for technical claims:
“Per-course isolation”


“Citation-required”


“No training on IP”


“Configurable retention”
 Should look like documentation labels.


D) Dividers
 Hairline separators between rows. Use them a lot. It increases “control-panel” credibility.
6) Hero mock (the centerpiece)
A split panel that looks like a real tool:
Left: Chat panel
Messages in simple bubbles, no emojis.


Citations appear as small clickable chips:


“Lecture 4, slide 12”


“Ch. 3, pp. 61–64”


Right: Status panel
 Shows the governance in a glance:
Scope Lock: ON


Outside sources: OFF


Citation Required: ON


Leakage risk: Low (with a simple meter)


This right panel is what makes publishers and department chairs go “okay, they actually built rails.”
7) Motion & effects
Keep it subtle and “professional software”:
Smooth scroll to anchors.


Micro fade-in on section load (optional).


Gentle animated meter fill (slow, calm).


Avoid flashy parallax, big glows, loud gradients.


8) Imagery policy
Prefer no stock photos. Use:
Product mock


Simple diagrams


Minimal icons


Maybe one abstract “boundary diagram” (boxes + arrows)


This makes it feel like a trust portal, not marketing.
9) The “Trust Center” section should feel special
Give it a slightly different treatment:
A brighter panel background than the rest (still dark).


More spacing.


More structure: checklists, definitions, short paragraphs.


A “Download Security One-Pager” block that looks like documentation.


10) Accessibility and readability
Contrast must be excellent (dark theme can’t be muddy).


Body text should never be thin or too gray.


Large tap targets on mobile.


Avoid long line lengths: cap body text width.
